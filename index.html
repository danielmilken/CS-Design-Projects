      <p> This project was inspired by my favorite show, Attack On Titan. One of my favorite scenes are when the two titans fight. This project was difficult but very fun.</p></div>

      <p>My most recent project was a research project, in which I tracked factors that effect my running. Overall, I found great results and was happy with everything. Below is my podcast I made, including all my graphs I made. Above is a basic graph of my sleep that I made on CodeHS.</p></div>

      <p> This is a photo of my sport, Cross Country. Cross country is something I am very passionate about. My team is like a family to me and I really enjoy running with them. By myself, running sucks, but when I am motivated by my team, I love running.
